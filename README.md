# Overview

My goal in writing this program was to learn how to use the Kotlin language and to have more practice with object oriented programming. 
I would like to do more programming in Android studio and that uses Kotlin.

My program is a task manager app. It allows the user to make personal tasks, work tasks, church related tasks, personal tasks, and miscellaneous tasks. 
The user can add tasks, delete tasks, and save their tasks to a file.

I like to make programs that are useful and solve a real world problem. This program can effectively help me keep track of my tasks in those categories.
